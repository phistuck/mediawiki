# Site layout assets

This folder content is going to be migrated to our static site domain.

It should help improve site performance and help us maintain site assets from one repository. Another advantage is that it will simplify our caching configuration to have all our static assets to a cookie less domain (www.webplatform.org).

See: [github.com/webplatform/www.webplatform.org/](https://github.com/webplatform/www.webplatform.org/tree/master/src/files)
